# SecureMaestro

Secure, automated practice tools for musicians — inspired by Vivaldi’s *Four Seasons* and engineered with AppSec principles.  
Blending music and security, SecureMaestro offers sandboxed tools for looping, tempo-mapping, and safe performance analysis.

## Features

- **Practice Looper**  
  Paste a YouTube link → select measures → auto-loop them at custom tempos (50%, 70%, 90%).  
  *Tech: pydub, ffmpeg*  

- **TempoMap**  
  Analyze performances (e.g., Karajan vs. student orchestra) → see where tempo speeds up/slows down.  
  *Tech: librosa, matplotlib*  

- **Orchestra Splitter**  
  Isolate or mute specific instruments (solo violin, continuo, etc.) for practice.  
  *Tech: spleeter/demucs*  

- **Performance Health Check**  
  Upload your own practice recording → get feedback on timing, intonation, and dynamics vs. a reference.  
  *Tech: DTW, pitch detection*  

- **Concert Metadata Collector**  
  Auto-scrape performance metadata (composer, conductor, year, etc.) for clean reference cards.  
  *Tech: YouTube API, MusicBrainz API*

## Security-First Engineering

Every feature is built with security-first design:
- Safe handling of user uploads (malware scan + sandboxing).  
- Input validation and rate limiting for YouTube/API integrations.  
- Automated scanning with **Bandit**, **Semgrep**, and **Snyk**.  
- CI/CD with GitHub Actions + CodeQL.  

This dual focus makes SecureMaestro both a **fun practice tool** and a **serious AppSec portfolio project**.

## Roadmap

- [ ] Repo scaffolding + secure Python setup  
- [ ] Practice Looper MVP  
- [ ] Add Bandit + Semgrep scanning  
- [ ] Implement TempoMap visualizations  
- [ ] Build Orchestra Splitter  
- [ ] Secure file upload pipeline (sandbox + scan)  
- [ ] Architecture diagram + design docs  
- [ ] README polish with visuals

## Architecture (Coming Soon)

_Planned diagram of system flow: input (YouTube/upload) → secure pipeline → analysis tools → outputs._

## Inspiration

> SecureMaestro is an experimental project blending classical music practice with modern application security principles.  
Inspired by Vivaldi’s *Four Seasons: Winter*, the goal is to create secure, automated tools that make learning music easier — while also showcasing secure coding and AppSec best practices.
