# SecureMaestro  


- Secure, automated practice tools for musicians — inspired by Vivaldi’s *Four Seasons* and engineered with AppSec principles.  
- Blending music and security, SecureMaestro is a side project where I’m experimenting with audio libraries (pydub, librosa, spleeter, etc.) while also building in secure coding habits from the start. Half portfolio, half “let's see how this goes.”  


## Features (planned + in progress)

- **Practice Looper**  
  Paste a YouTube link, choose a section, and loop it at slower tempos (50%, 70%, 90%).  
  *Tech: pydub + ffmpeg*  

- **TempoMap**  
  Compare two performances (Karajan vs. a student orchestra) → plot where tempos drift.  
  *Tech: librosa, matplotlib*  

- **Orchestra Splitter**  
  Isolate or mute specific instruments (e.g. violin vs. continuo) for practice.  
  *Tech: spleeter, demucs*  

- **Performance Health Check**  
  Upload your own practice → get feedback on timing, intonation, dynamics vs. a reference.  
  *Tech: DTW, pitch detection*  

- **Concert Metadata Collector**  
  Pull composer/conductor/year info from YouTube and auto-generate a clean reference card.

## Security Notes  

Since this doubles as an AppSec learning exercise, I’m baking in security from the start:  

- Sandbox + malware scan on uploads  
- Input validation / rate limiting on external APIs  
- Static analysis with **Bandit** + **Semgrep**  
- CI/CD checks with GitHub Actions + CodeQL

## Roadmap (rough sketch)

- [ ] Scaffold repo + secure Python setup  
- [ ] MVP of Practice Looper  
- [ ] Add Bandit + Semgrep scanning  
- [ ] Build TempoMap visualizations  
- [ ] Orchestra Splitter prototype  
- [ ] Secure upload pipeline (sandbox + scan)  
- [ ] Architecture diagram + notes

## Why this exists  

I wanted to:  
- Blend two weirdly specific interests (music + AppSec).  
- Learn audio processing libraries.  
- Show that even small/fun projects can be built with security in mind.  

Also: the name **SecureMaestro** was too good not to run with.

### Notes  
This README & repo will evolve once I actually get code in — right now it’s mostly a working sketch.
